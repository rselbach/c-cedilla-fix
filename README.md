This is here so that I can find it easily next time I need to set up a new Linux
box and don't have to spend time going through a ton of out of data articles
about how to do this.

Just put the variables from `environment` in your `/etc/environment` and then
copy `XCompose` to `$HOME/.XCompose`

That's it.
